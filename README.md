Schemette
=========

What
----
Schemette is a small subset of [Scheme](http://www.r6rs.org/) implemented in Java 8. The implementation is based on the meta-circular interpreter introduced in the book [Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node76.html). Schemette is also influenced by Peter Norvig's implementation of [Lisp in Python](http://norvig.com/lispy.html).

Why
---
The purpose is to explore the implementation of functional concepts in Lisp and new features of Java 8, namely lambdas and streams.
